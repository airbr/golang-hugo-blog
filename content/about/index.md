ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! My name is Morgan. I am an [American New Zealander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_New_Zealanders) living in [Bellingham, Washington State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellingham,_Washington). 

I have been programming for approximately 5.5+ years after picking up developer skills after graduating and working in a different field. I have worked on software programs that are relied upon chairside by Orthodontists to provide live information about their case. I have made front end features used in the websites of a Fortune 500 company. I have managed volunteers in my spare time for non-profits. I am confident enough to say I have things to offer the right opportunity!

I worked at the start-up [EasyRx](https://easyrxcloud.com/) based out of Atlanta, GA for 4+ years focusing on the web for that company. I most recently have worked at [WompMobile](https://www.wompmobile.com/) focusing on web development also. 

I graduated with an [LLB](https://www.otago.ac.nz/courses/qualifications/llb.html)/[BA](https://www.otago.ac.nz/courses/subjects/clas.html) from the [University of Otago](https://www.otago.ac.nz/). 

I enjoy art, reading and drinking a lot of coffee.
