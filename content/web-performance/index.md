ðŸ‘‹ Hey there

I love web performance. It is a mixture of the kinds of challenges I love.

This website is statically generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for performance.

Have you tried running tests before on websites? Consider checking out Lighthouse for a start:

* [Lighthouse - Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/#devtools)

Ideally you should be using several tools to gain a bigger picture. 

Then, in no particular order, I reccomend entering a website you are interested in into some of the following:

* [Pagespeed Insights - https://pagespeed.web.dev/](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)
* [Yellow Lab Tools - https://yellowlab.tools/](https://yellowlab.tools/)
* [WebPageTest - https://www.webpagetest.org/](https://www.webpagetest.org/)

There are lots of resources out there, but first you should run some tests and get your curiosity flowing!

All the resources and community are out there and it is just more a matter of sparking that initial interest to get you going is my philosophy. 

### Carbon control 

When it comes to measuring how much carbon a website impacts you want something with resources and engineering. More importantly, you want to get your message across effectively. WebPageTest provides this capability with its reports.

I endorse WebPageTest's methodology and hopefully it can only be improved with time!
