ðŸ‘‹ Hey there

I love web performance. It is a mixture of the kinds of challenges I love.

This website is statically generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for performance.

Have you tried running tests before on websites? Consider checking out:

* [Lighthouse - Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/#devtools)

Ideally you should be using several tools to gain a bigger picture.

Then, in no particular order, I reccomend entering a website you are interested in into some of the following:

* [Pagespeed Insights - https://pagespeed.web.dev/](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)
* [Yellow Lab Tools - https://yellowlab.tools/](https://yellowlab.tools/)
* [DebugBear - https://www.debugbear.com/test/website-speed](https://www.debugbear.com/test/website-speed)
* [WebPageTest - https://www.webpagetest.org/](https://www.webpagetest.org/)

There are lots of resources out there, but first you should run some tests and get your curiosity flowing!
