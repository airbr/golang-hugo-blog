ðŸ‘‹ Hey there

I love web performance. It is a mixture of the kinds of challenges I love.

This website is statically generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for performance. Static site generators mean that useful HTML is prioritized first in what is delivered to a browser usually and performance usually improves on some key metrics. It works pretty fast! It is also pretty basic because I like it that way sometimes.  

Have you tried running tests before on websites? Consider checking out a local Lighthouse test run for a start:

* [Lighthouse - Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/#devtools)

Ideally you should be using several tools to gain a bigger picture. Local "lab" tests have limitations. 

Then, in no particular order, I reccomend entering a website you are interested in into some of the following:

* [Pagespeed Insights - https://pagespeed.web.dev/](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)
* [Yellow Lab Tools - https://yellowlab.tools/](https://yellowlab.tools/)
* [WebPageTest - https://www.webpagetest.org/](https://www.webpagetest.org/)

There are lots of resources out there, but first you should run some tests and get your curiosity flowing!

### Next: Performance Monitoring, but first, run some tests!

As you should have seen in my cookie notice, I am running mPulse and Speedcurve on this website. Will write something as I go!
