blurb: Measuring Carbon impact is important and the web is no exception

It is time we start to more comprehensively and actively measure the carbon impact of websites.

There are a number of challenges to calculating this impact but I was very enthusiastic when I saw that WebPageTest introduced a carbon control feature. The team at WebPageTest bring some engineering and design skill to communicating the impact of a websites carbon footprint.

### Example: [My Personal Website Carbon Control results](https://www.webpagetest.org/result/230514_AiDc8C_3AV/7/carboncontrol/)

### [Launch blog by WPT: Measure & Improve Your Site's Footprint with Carbon Control from Catchpoint WebPageTest](https://blog.webpagetest.org/posts/carbon-control/)

I have tried alternatives, two small independent operators, and I had not optimal experiences with previous carbon measuring platforms. It just felt hard to put weight on the numbers. WebPageTest is an established brand that brings some good experience to the table and I am happy with their methodology so far. 

More importantly I am convinced they can only go on to improve and calibrate the carbon control tab with more information. Kudos to Catchpoint/WebPageTest!
