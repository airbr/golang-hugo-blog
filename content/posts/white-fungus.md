I have been a long time reader of White Fungus, and have been in contact with the editors years ago as I was a volunteer at the [Black Star Books space in Dunedin, New Zealand circa 2013-2014](https://cargocollective.com/Zinefest). White Fungus was one of my favorite things to read at the space.

How awesome it was to receive an early edition of their new printed magazine!
