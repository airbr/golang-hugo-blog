I plan to welcome the fall and winter this year for they are natural parts of the seasons and give a richness and vibrancy to life. I am intending to welcome the changing season the best I can. This fall I am working on some various goals:

* Relaxation
* Sustainability

I will continue to maintain this website, with infrequent updates through the season.

### Relaxation

Relaxing obviously ideally comes naturally. When it doesn't, consider the whole list of things going on in your life and see how you can optimize as many as possible so that relaxation just starts to happen. A key ingredient in this process is the ability to subtract things where possible to have less on ones plate so that there is less to worry about.

I am playing Tennis on some fall days still- Exercise does actually help a great deal to relax.

In terms of positive things that I am thankful for:
* Relaxed music
* Plenty of good sparkling water
* Big deep breathes

With a few of these things you can be on track for a relaxed day.

### Sustainability

I was really pleased to see the [level of discussion in minutes from meetings](https://www.w3.org/2024/09/25-sustainability-minutes.html) at the W3C Conference TPAC about the Web Sustainability Guidelines. I have volunteered and supported the work done on the draft guidelines for over a year now. I will be keeping an eye out for things to do this winter in support of that valuable volunteer work.

## Conclusion: Fall/Winter 2024

Is going to be relaxing and sustainable!
