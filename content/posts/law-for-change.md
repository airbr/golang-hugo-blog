[An Article of Otago Law Magazine recently praised the efforts of the student charity Law For Change which I co-founded in 2012/2013](/otago-law-issue.pdf)

Per Page 72 -- I am so proud!

The charity I helped start has been going well and alive for over a decade. I am so happy and excited to share to people the stories of Law For Change:
