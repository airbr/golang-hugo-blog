Life is full of many projects and I have one most important project which is [to get married](/posts/engagement). There are many interesting side projects in my life along the way and I have a few highlights in no particular order:

### Tested a lot of Websites - just in my spare time

The first test I ran with WebPageTest was *Dec 07, 2022 5:14:31 AM UTC	Virginia USA - EC2 - Chrome - Emulated Motorola G (gen 4) - 4G*.

According to WebPageTest I have ran 569 URLs, each time for multiple runs of the test, so likely triple that or more runs of WebPageTest. Possibly this makes me a power user of the .org website as an individual manually running tests.

### Active contributor to the Web Sustainability Guidelines - W3C community group.

#### [I am a participant of the Sustainable Web Design Community Group Active in the Development of The Web Sustainability Guidelines](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#participants-of-the-swd-cg-active-in-the-development-of-this-document).

We are making guidelines that will effectively be geared at the entire internet!

### Committed a fair number of times to GitHub

656 contributions in the last year

Keep in mind this is just stuff in my spare time

### Archived a lot of websites with Pinboard.in

I exported my archive from Pinboard. A total of 3.1gb zipped, 5.33 unzipped files of websites. All bookmarked in the last year. 

### Active contributor to the New Zealand Greens

I helped author the [public facing organizational README for the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand](https://github.com/nzgreens).

I helped set up a [Playwright](/posts/playwright-2023) testing library solution that engaged other volunteers in meaningful and pro active use of front end testing to further ensure quality of services.

### Active contributor to [MyDSA](https://tech.dsausa.org/mydsa/) - Democratic Socialists of America

I am working on HTML and CSS for the emerging features of [MyDSA](https://tech.dsausa.org/mydsa/) for the National Tech Committee.

Particularly I worked to advocate for clean semantic as possible HTML and incorporating testing into the mix.
