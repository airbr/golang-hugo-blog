1. Enjoyment. I get excited and intrigued from reading website performance tests of various kinds.

2. Civic duty. The performance of the web is generally a public interest issue.

3. Someday... work will call for it. The skills involved in understanding web performance issues are transferrable and important skills

WebPageTest offers a premium web service on top of OSS. It is possible to setup a private instance and I am working towards that goal. I am a big fan of WebPageTest, so much so that I ran out of my 1000 runs well before my plan renewal:

#### What did I spend 1000 runs on?

I went on so many *investigations*. Questions that the tests helped answer or provided some kind of picture of a different style of waterfall. 

There is so much more that each WPT test result offers for analysis other than just the visuals, but those are often the most compelling:

I wanted to see what [my alma maters homepage looked like on desktop Chrome on a Cable connection](https://www.webpagetest.org/result/230219_BiDcNS_30X/). Pretty good, visually complete in approx 3.3 seconds.

I wanted to see what the loading proces of the [websites of the MLB, NFL, NHL and NBA all looked like visually](https://www.webpagetest.org/video/compare.php?tests=230222_AiDcVC_4FC,230222_AiDcW6_4FA,230222_AiDcFJ_4F9,230222_AiDc70_4F8).   These major league websites have a lot of ads and trackers it seems

I wanted to see how my [local city Government's website performed under lower power connection conditions like Slow 3G](https://www.webpagetest.org/video/compare.php?tests=230223_AiDc9Y_H1K,230223_AiDcCG_H0T,230223_BiDc6F_GVM,230223_BiDcWR_E3Z). I am still experimenting to figure out how many could be affected by serious slowness at lower connection speeds: some initial tests had it taking over a minute to populate information.

I wanted to see how my [personal Ko-Fi donation page performed](https://www.webpagetest.org/result/230223_BiDc4D_4KB/). It performs very well, despite taking on a significant embed script from Ko-Fi. Kept everything else lean around it I guess!

I wanted to see how a selection of [web performance products and services websites stacked up performance wise](https://www.webpagetest.org/video/compare.php?tests=230221_AiDcZS_80Y,230221_AiDc4P_80X,230221_AiDcE2_80W,230221_AiDc29_80T,230221_AiDcEJ_80R,230221_AiDcZ8_80P):

![Speed Services Filmstrip](/speed-services.gif)

Services working on website speed seem to take speed seriously! Good sign.

I wanted to see what [Hacker News performed like](https://www.webpagetest.org/result/230221_AiDcSW_6JV/). 17Kb over total downloaded on a first hit, and then even less on repeat view. Lean website!

![Hacker News Crux Data](/crux-hacker-news.png)

Hacker News's CrUX data is basically all green. 

## I will keep experimenting...
    
In a months time, when the runs arrive March 16. I love this service but not enough financial means to jump up to 5000 tests a month. 

In the meantime I have some great free options for doing more investigations.
