The Web is great and grand but I have been working to consolidate my presence on it. There is a lot I don't use anymore or have moved on from that I wanted to consolidate. 

This has included closing or archiving dozens of projects spread across many platforms such as Netlify, GitHub, Replit, Glitch and DigitalOcean. I removed my account from several Slack workspaces, and set several domain names I used to use to expire.

I removed and downgraded several services, including google workspace plans on a custom domain. 

This website survives the initital consolidation...

#### I feel fresh. Have you consolidated recently?
