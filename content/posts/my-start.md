# The light is go!

There are many traffic lights in the world but [this one is mine](https://codepen.io/airbridge/pen/oLBvYr). This coded traffic light with HTML , CSS and JS helped kickstart my career that has been spanning for over 5 years doing web development.

The challenge was hard at the time but now seems trivial. The task was to create a traffic light that uses JavaScript to be interactive with buttons for Stop, Slow and Go. This was a screening exercise for my bootcamp. 

In this code sample, hosted on Codepen, you can see the HTML, CSS and JavaScript needed to create a functional stop light:

{{< rawhtml >}}
<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-default-tab="html,result" data-slug-hash="oLBvYr" data-user="airbridge" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

Observed easier to solve problems working from the 'base' of the HTML through to CSS to JS across the screen. Took a while to spot but once spotted was easy.

It is not a special comment, but it is a marker in time that I look back on and remember with some awe.

As detailed in my other posts and in my [About page](/about) I have been spending a lot of time working on the web ever since. But the traffic light is part of where I got my start.
