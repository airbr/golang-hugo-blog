# Appreciating the [good work](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/), people doing the effort

The community led [organization of contributors](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/contributors) behind the web almanac is something to behold and admire. Just look at their organization -- the enormous effort put in -- it is truly impressive. Lets just list some of the virtues of this project made of:

## Values led, data driven

Look at the chapter on sustainability, particularly [What's New](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/sustainability#whats-new-in-web-sustainability). See the effort put in to the research and the science basically, it is so good.

## They have an accessibility strategy

Check out their [well written accessibility notice](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/accessibility-statement).

## All about the web

### Example: [DocType - Markup Chapter](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/markup#doctypes)

I have [written about DocType's before](/posts/doctype). Now from the Almanac I can see some hard data behind the concept:

> 93% of all mobile pages use the standard HTML doctype. That is, `<!DOCTYPE html>`.

> This is 3 percentage points higher than the 2022 data. The surprising part is the next most popular: XHTML 1.1 Transitionalâ€”but slowly disappearing (2.7%, down from 3.9% in 2022).

### Example: [Performance - Time to First Byte](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/performance#time-to-first-byte-ttfb)

Sometimes not much changes year to year. This itself is very useful data.

### Example: [Markup - Custom Elements](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/markup#custom-elements)

Sometimes a chapter will inform you -- or confirm -- a trend. With confidence we can say that custom elements, one feature of web components, is on the rise in usage.

### Example: [Accessibility - font sizes statistics](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/accessibility#zooming-and-scaling)

> How font sizes are defined also affects the readability, as pixels are not as flexible as other units. Pixel (px) use is 65% in desktop and 66% in mobile. The use of em has increased to 9% from 6% in 2022. rem was at 6% in 2022, and has reduced to 4% now. There is not a significant increase in the use of em or rem since 2022, even though it often gives the user a better experience when they increase or decrease their font size in their browser settings.
