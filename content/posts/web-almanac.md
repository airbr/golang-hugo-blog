# Appreciating the [good work](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/), people doing the effort

The community led [organization of contributors](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/contributors) behind the web almanac is something to behold and admire. Just look at their organization, the effort put in, it is truly impressive. Lets just list some of the virtues of this project made of:

## Values led, data driven

Look at the chapter on sustainability, particularly [What's New](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/sustainability#whats-new-in-web-sustainability). See the effort put in to the research and the science basically, it is so good.

## They have an accessibility strategy

Check out their [well written accessibility notice](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/accessibility-statement).

## All about the web

# Example: [DocType - Markup Chapter](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/markup#doctypes)

I have [written about before](/posts/doctype). Now from the Almanac I can see some hard data behind the issue.

> 93% of all mobile pages use the standard HTML doctype. That is, `<!DOCTYPE html>`.

> This is 3 percentage points higher than the 2022 data. The surprising part is the next most popular: XHTML 1.1 Transitionalâ€”but slowly disappearing (2.7%, down from 3.9% in 2022).
