# Appreciating the [good work](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/), people doing the effort

The community led [organization of contributors](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/contributors) behind the web almanac is something to behold and admire. Just look at their organization -- the enormous effort put in -- it is truly impressive. Lets just list some of the virtues of this project made of:

## Values led, data driven

Look at the chapter on sustainability, particularly [What's New](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/sustainability#whats-new-in-web-sustainability). See the effort put in to the research and the science basically, it is so good.

## They have an accessibility strategy

Check out their [well written accessibility notice](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/accessibility-statement).

## All about the web

# Example: [DocType - Markup Chapter](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/markup#doctypes)

I have [written about DocType's before](/posts/doctype). Now from the Almanac I can see some hard data behind the concept:

> 93% of all mobile pages use the standard HTML doctype. That is, `<!DOCTYPE html>`.

> This is 3 percentage points higher than the 2022 data. The surprising part is the next most popular: XHTML 1.1 Transitionalâ€”but slowly disappearing (2.7%, down from 3.9% in 2022).

# Example: [Performance - Time to First Byte](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/performance#time-to-first-byte-ttfb)

Sometimes not much changes year to year, but this effort and methods and techniques evolve.

# Example: [Markup - Custom Elements](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2024/markup#custom-elements)

Sometimes a chapter will inform you -- or confirm -- a trend. With confidence we can say that custom elements, one feature of web components, is on the rise in usage.
